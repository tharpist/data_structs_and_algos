"""
Iteration can be faster than recursion
if you can can divide a large problem into smaller subproblems you can use recursion
Design an algorith to compute nth
Write code to list the n
Implement a method to compute all
The prominent usage of recursion in data structures is for trees and graphs
It is used in amny algorithms
